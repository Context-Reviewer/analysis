      "body": "The Robbie Harvey : · Man Sentenced To Life For SA'ing 10-Year-Old Girl. A 23-year-old man from Lucedale, Mississippi, named Justin Andrew Busby, was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of sexually abusing a 10-year-old girl during a family vacation in Destin, Florida. The victim did not immediately disclose the abuse but later reported it to her parents after the family returned to Mississippi, according to the State Attorney's Office. Busby was arrested in May 2023 following an investigation by the Lucedale Police Department. During questioning, he did not deny the allegations but attempted to minimize his actions. Busby, who was over 18 at the time of the offense and described as a trusted family member to the victim, was found guilty by a jury of sexual battery of a victim under 12 years old. Circuit Judge David Oberliesen imposed the life sentence. In addition to the Florida conviction, Busby faces charges in George County, Mississippi, including one count of sexual battery of a victim under 14 and two counts of lustful touching of a minor, according to WLBT and George County Assistant District Attorney George Huffman. These allegations stem from incidents reportedly occurring in Mississippi, and Huffman noted that an 8-year-old child has also accused Busby of sexual abuse. 3 comments",
